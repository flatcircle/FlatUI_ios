# Flat Circle UI kit

A collection of ui components and enhancements


## FCTextView

### Features
- Placeholder text
- Character limit

### Usage
- `FCTextView` sets itself as it's delegate, so that it internally manages the placeholder and character limit rules. So don't attempt to set `delegate`
- Use `customDelegate` to handle text changes
